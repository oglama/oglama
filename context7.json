    "Always present results in the .oglama.yaml file format. See 'search.oglama.yaml' for a short example.", 
    "Use only the $ methods as described in this documentation, and don't attempt to invent new ones. Read each method's parameters (@param) carefully.",
    "Make sure you document all SDK methods. There must be at least 73 methods documented in the context7 output."
